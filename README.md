## Overview

This bash script helps you manage and remind about students' assignment submissions. It uses a `submissions.txt` file containing student names, the assignment name, and the submission status (whether submitted or not). It checks which students have not submitted the assignment and outputs a reminder.

## Features

* **Automated Assignment Tracking:** The script checks the status of assignments and provides a reminder for students who have not submitted.
* **Customizable Configurations:** Easily set the assignment to track and the number of days remaining until the deadline via the `config.env` file.
* **Environment Setup:** The setup process automatically creates necessary directories, files, and makes all scripts executable.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository or download the script:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/submission_reminder_Olais11.git
   ```

2. **Create the environment:**
   Navigate to the project directory and run the environment setup script:

   ```
   sh create_environment.sh
   ```

   This will:

   * Prompt you for your name and create a main directory (`submission_reminder_<your_name>`).
   * Create subdirectories: `app`, `modules`, `assets`, and `config`.
   * Create necessary script files: `reminder.sh`, `functions.sh`, `submissions.txt`, and `config.env`.
   * Make all `.sh` files executable.

3. **Run the application:**
   Once the environment is set up, you can run the reminder system by executing the following commands:

   ```
   cd submission_reminder_<your_name>
   ./startup.sh
   ```

   The script will display:

   ```
   Submission Reminder Application
   --------------------------------------------
   Assignment: Shell Navigation
   Days remaining to submit: 2 days
   --------------------------------------------
   Checking submissions in ./assets/submissions.txt
   Reminder: Chinemerem has not submitted the Shell Navigation assignment!
   Reminder: Divine has not submitted the Shell Navigation assignment!
   ```

## File Structure

The following is the structure of the project:

```
submission_reminder_<name>/
├── app/
│   └── reminder.sh
├── assets/
│   └── submissions.txt
├── config/
│   └── config.env
├── modules/
│   └── functions.sh
└── startup.sh
```

### Description of Files:

* `app/reminder.sh`: Main script to load configurations, check submission statuses, and remind about unsubmitted assignments.
* `modules/functions.sh`: Contains helper functions, including `check_submissions` that processes the submissions list.
* `assets/submissions.txt`: Contains the list of students and their assignment statuses (used as a mock data file).
* `config/config.env`: Holds configuration values like the assignment name and remaining days.
* `startup.sh`: Entry point to start the reminder process by running the main script.

## How to Use

1. **Change the Assignment:** Edit the `config/config.env` file to specify the assignment you want to track and the remaining days for submission:

   ```
   ASSIGNMENT="Shell Navigation"
   DAYS_REMAINING=2
   ```

2. **Add/Modify Student Submissions:** You can edit the `assets/submissions.txt` file to add or modify students and their assignment statuses. Make sure the format is:

   ```
   student, assignment, submission status
   ```

3. **Run the Reminder Script:** Execute `startup.sh` to get a reminder about unsubmitted assignments. It will output the list of students who have not submitted the assignment.
